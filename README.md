# Pico Dashboard aka PiChart

A tiny dashboard solution for displaying data from an MQTT server

## Notes
- This uses the [Pimoroni Pico Display Pack](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-display-pack?variant=32368664215635) or [Pimoroni Pico Display 2.0"](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-display-pack-2-0?variant=39374122582099), which use ST7789 display driver. 
- I'm using the Pimoroni 'batteries included' MicroPython build so if you get a st7789 not found, this is why. Grab that from the Pimoroni website.

I've also renamed the library from `chart.py` to `pichart.py`
